Dock ‘n’ Roll


```
This simulation models the docking process between two spacecraft, showing how their relative orientations and rotations appear from different perspectives. It visualizes the effect of varying RPM speeds on their motion, including how the docking angle, speed, and alignment change as the spacecraft rotate at different rates. The goal is to offer a realistic view of the dynamics involved in the docking maneuver, helping to understand how even slight differences in rotation can affect the success of the operation.
